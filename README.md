In this project we will study the implementation of a naive bayes classifier.
The goal will be to cassify films reviews positive or negative.

We will compare diferent implementation and text pretreatment and their results.

You will need to have a python environement with usual data treatment libraries, 
also we will use the multiset library to ease handling of vocabularies and frequences of words

All the answers and code is in nlp1_tp1.ipynb
